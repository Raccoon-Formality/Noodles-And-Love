This source code if free to use and modify for whatever project you might like to use. However, I will note that this code wasn't built for being usible for other people, it's very jank and was made mainly so I could understand it, but if there is something you can learn from it then go for it and be my guest.

The character sprites are owned by the artist and cannot be used in any project without permission.
