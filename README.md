 If you do edit this game or make mods, PLEASE be sure to edit the pdxinfo file in the Source folder so it is not my game's information anymore. This will make sure there is not conflicts with save files or updates on the device.

This source code if free to use and modify for whatever project you might like to use. However, I will note that this code wasn't built for being usible for other people, it's very jank and was made mainly so I could understand it, but if there is something you can learn from it then go for it and be my guest.

The character sprites are owned by the artist and cannot be used in any project without permission.
